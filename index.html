  <h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;"> Powerpoint to Mp4 Converter </h1> <br /><br />
The below is an application where the user can upload a powerpoint and get it back with a voice over text.<br />
  This comes from the Google API and uses the Speaker Notes to generate the text to speech. <br />
  When this button is clicked, it will generate a mp4 file, featuring a video of the powerpoint with a voice over. <br />
  Please use sparingly, as it does cost money for me to run. <br /><br />
  
<form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  Select Power Point to upload:
  <input type="file" name="fileToUpload" id="fileToUpload">
  <input type="submit" value="Upload Power Point" name="submit">
